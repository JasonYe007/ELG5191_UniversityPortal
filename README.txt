Welcome to the "ELG 5191 Design of Distributed System Software" project code repository.

Set-up instructions:

1. Follow the project set-up instructions parts 1 to 3 in order to configure Eclipse and Geronimo.

2. Check out the code from the repository. I recommend using TortoiseGit at "http://code.google.com/p/tortoisegit/downloads/list"

3. Open eclipse and set the workspace to the checked-out "Workspace" folder

4. In Eclipse go to File --> Import --> Maven Folder --> Existing Maven Projects

Post on the NCCT forum if you need any help.

Cheers.
